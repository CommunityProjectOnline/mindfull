## Notes

- **YOU** will write all JavaScript - I'll guide and explain
- Focus on JavaScript, Node.js, Git, Docker learning
- HTML/CSS I'll handle quickly so we can focus on logic
- Always timestamp everything for timeline feature
- Keep Memory cards draggable and saveable
- Stars should be subtle but meaningful
- Timeline is KEY feature - prioritize this

---

**Remember:** This isn't a note app. This is a life visualization tool. Every Memory, every connection, every moment of growth is captured and can be replayed. That's what makes MindFull special.
